However it does not follow the recommendations of the ECF specification to the letter and is therefore not compatible and/or interoperable with any other existing ECF implementation; nor is it intended to be.</p><p>This draft constitutes what is considered to be a minimum implementation of the ECF specification. All of the Major Design Elements (MDEs) and Operations (represented as Components, Resources, and Methods or Patterns) are included in the documentation for completeness. Those that are not being used for this implementation are marked as <strong>Not Implemented</strong>.</p><p>The proposed implementation differs from the ECF specifications and recommendations in several aspects:</p><ol><li>It is implemented as a RESTful API, which has been based on the Web Services Service Interaction Profile 2.1 Specification.</li><li>This initial implementation utilizes the XML schemas and examples defined in the ECF specification for example purposes only. The intent is to translate the messages and schemas into JSON.</li></ol><h3 id=Scope><a href=#Scope>Scope</a></h3><p>The intent of this specification is similar to that of the ECF specifications in that it describes components needed to develop an electronic court filing system.</p><p>Basic familiarity with the <a href=http://docs.oasis-open.org/legalxml-courtfiling/specs/ecf/v4.01/ecf-v4.01-spec/ecf-v4.01-spec.doc>ECF Specification</a> is assumed.</p><p>This initial draft has been developed to provide a foundation to support discussion, feedback, collaboration, and the further design and development work needed to develop the API for it’s intended purpose in the CSB-eFiling system. It is not intended to be a complete specification. Details will be added and changes made as discussions proceed and the design evolves.</p><p>Examples of work to be done:</p><ul><li>Take a closer look at how files relate to the messages and how they flow through the ECF API to see what concepts we may be able to borrow.</li><li>Determine appropriate methods for ensuring message and document integrity (support for non-repudiation).</li><li>Determine security implementation(s).</li><li>Convert XML messaging structures to JSON. Requires a review of the defined message to determine what may be extracted and incorporated into the API functionality. For example, additional query and/or filter parameters.</li></ul><h3 id=Filing-Preparation-to-Court-Record-Process-Flow><a href=#Filing-Preparation-to-Court-Record-Process-Flow>Filing Preparation to Court Record Process Flow</a></h3><h4 id=minumum-implementation>Minumum Implementation</h4><p>This section describes the sequence of operations in the proposed minimum implementation.</p><p>The flow involves two parties (three logical components):</p><ul><li>A Filer (represented by the <strong>Filer</strong> Component)</li><li>And a Court (represented by the <strong>Registry</strong> and <strong>Court</strong> Components)</li></ul><p>The resources and methods supporting the processes in this flow are listed below, the equivalent ECF operation for each is listed in square brackets. The business rules associated with the methods is documented as part of the description of the method itself (within the API documentation). The resources and methods listed in bold are required and MUST occur in every successful filing as long as sending and receiving components are implemented.
